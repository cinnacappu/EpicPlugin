# EpicPlugin
A plugin with stuff (commands) that might be useful I think
EpicPlugin is an epic plugin that has a lot of commands that can help with how you play Minecraft. For example: /c, /a, /s, /sp, changes your game mode, and there are a lot more. This is my first plugin and I wanted to test my programming skills (they're bad) but still consider reviewing if you liked it. This plugin also has some "fun" commands.
